## Common Git Commands for Future Updates

```bash

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues:
If you get authentication errors, you might need to:
1. Set up SSH keys, or
2. Use Personal Access Token instead of password

### Large Files:
If you have large files (>100MB), consider using Git LFS:
```bash
git lfs track "*.png"
git lfs track "*.mp3"
```

### Repository Already Exists:
If you get "repository already exists" error:
```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/yourusername/snake-ladder-game.git
```
